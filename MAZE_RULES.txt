TEST ---->The playeris placedin a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts. There are also someinterceptor robots thatwill try to destroythe player. If the playertouchesthe maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game (and the player!).The robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/postsor when they collide with each other.Every  time  the  player  moves  in  any  direction(horizontally,  vertically,  or  diagonally)to  a  contiguous  cell,  each  robot movesone cellcloser  to the new player's location,  in  whichever  direction  is  the  shortest  path.  The  robots  have  no vision sensors but they have an accurate odoursensor that allows them to follow the player!There is one hope: make the robots hit the maze or each other. If all of them are destroyed, the player wins.
